 <h1 style="color: goldenrod;">history of basketball</h1>
 <hr>
 <h3 style="color: khaki;">Basketball was invented by James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1891. Within a few decades, the new game became popular throughout the United States as an indoor sport. The popularity spread overseas and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) was organized in 1932 in Geneva, Switzerland</h3>
 <hr>
 <h4 style="letter-spacing:5px ;">James Naismith, a teacher at a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts, is credited with inventing basketball in 1891.
    The first “hoops” were actually just peach baskets and the first backboards were made of wire.
    The game became an official Olympic event at the Summer Games in Berlin, Germany in 1936</h4>
 <hr>   
<h3 style="word: spacing 5px;">James Naismith was a Canadian-American physical educator, physician, Christian chaplain, and sports coach, best known as the inventor of the game of basketball. After moving to the United States, he wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program.</h3>

 <hr>   
 <h2 style="text-shadow:4px 6px gold;">For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name. The students were enthusiastic.</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3 style="text-shadow:4px 6px orange;">The time line, in basketball, is a name for the center line that reflects the rule that the offensive team has a limited amount of time to advance the ball past this line, from the backcourt to the frontcourt, in a scoring drive.</h3>
 <hr>
 <h4 style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Your rulebook has 10 rules – plus, of course, a large number of articles and sub-sections. But still,10 basic over-arching rules are at the heart of the game. Question 2) How many rules were there in the original game of basketball? If you said 13, you'd be correct.</h4>
 <hr>
 <h5 style="text-shadow:4px 6px yellow;">A basketball game starts at the centre of the court when the ball is thrown high up by the referee and one player from each team competing to gain possession. The team that catches the ball, or in possession, is called the offensive team while the team not on the ball is the defensive team</h5>
